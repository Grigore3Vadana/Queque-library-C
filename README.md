# Queque-library-C

This program provides a basic implementation of a queue data structure in C programming language. The code includes the following functions:

createQueue(): This function creates a new queue and returns a pointer to the created queue.
enQueue(Queue *, Data): This function adds an element to the rear of the queue.
deQueue(Queue *): This function removes and returns the front element of the queue.
isEmpty(Queue *): This function checks if the queue is empty or not.
deleteQueue(Queue *): This function deletes the queue and frees the memory allocated to it.
The main function demonstrates the usage of the queue by creating a queue, adding some elements to it, removing them and deleting the queue
